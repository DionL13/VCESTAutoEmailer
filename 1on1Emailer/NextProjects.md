One-on-One sign-ins:

<p> Tutors and students both scan a barcode on their lanyards, sending them an SMS for where they need to be to meet their session partner. The scanning of the barcode inputs the student into a row in a spreadsheet 
which stores them firstly as a student, but also where they are in the numbered 1-5 spots to wait for their tutor and which session they are apart of. The tutor then scans the barcode and gets sent an SMS for which
spot the student is waiting, and is also stored in the sheet. Once the tutor and student are both in the sheet, delete them both from the sheet. </p>
