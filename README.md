<p> This code is built for the VCE Summer Tutoring (VCEST) Program Operations team. The program runs every year in January, with the code built to optimize and automate repetitive tasks that the Operations team are responsible for. </p>

<p> At this stage, the current code assists with: 
  <ul>
    <li>
      1:1 requests and sign ups: automating confirmation emails to both parties if no issues are found within the request
    </li>
    <li>
      <br>(In Progress)</br>
      Notifying team tutors of tutor absences and finding a class cover if necessary (or if a team tutor requests a class cover)
    </li>
  </ul>
